In the tapestry of time, a darkened thread,
Lies the cruelty of man, where hearts have bled.
Through history's pages, its stain does creep,
A legacy of tears, where sorrow runs deep.

With fists of anger, and hearts of stone,
Man has oftentimes cast a heartless tone.
Innocence shattered, compassion laid low,
The seeds of cruelty in fertile hearts grow.
